# 📂 Client Rotational Assignment Automation

This repo streamlines the weekly client assignments among consultants, ensuring fair and balanced workload distribution through an automated rotation system. It involves an Excel data source, Python scripts, and a tracking mechanism to maintain state between runs.

I used this when I when automating the process of updating weekly clients with the team I led from Datalytics-Tech. I also used this for my lead assistant analysis which helped me distribute work to my other TAs and send emails quickly if I needed to. I changed the names to "Client {number}" for privacy reasons instead of names and initialized my team consultants. Weekly it would run and change. It's very possible to randomly distribute as well.

### 📌 Project Overview

This system automates client assignment to consultants each week, rotating the assignments to evenly distribute workload. Perfect for managing consulting engagements, teaching assistant duties, or any role where consistent rotation is required.

### 📁 File Descriptions

**1. Client_List.xlsx**

Purpose: Contains the full list of clients who need to be assigned to consultants each week.

Format: Excel spreadsheet with client names listed in the first column.

**2. rotation_state.txt**

Purpose: Stores the current rotation state (index) of consultants.

Format: Plain text file containing a single integer representing the rotation position.

Usage: Ensures continuity and fairness by tracking the consultant who should receive the next set of clients.

**3. Python Automation Script (.ipynb)**

Purpose: Reads the client list, manages rotation state, assigns clients evenly, and outputs the weekly assignments.

Format: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing Python scripts for automation.

Usage: Central script to perform the rotation logic and generate assignments each week.

**4. Weekly_Consultant_Client_Assignments_.xlsx**

Purpose: Outputs the weekly distribution of clients to consultants after running jupyter notebook.

Format: Formatted Excel spreadsheet with clear and readable assignments.

Usage: Generated by the automation script, this file serves as the weekly reference for consultant-client engagements.
